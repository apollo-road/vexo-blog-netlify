[Check out the article](https://medium.com/practicecomesfirst/dr-jordan-b-petersons-10-step-guide-to-clearer-thinking-through-essay-writing-1ab79a94937 "Jordan Peterson - how to write an essay")
# Summary
Peterson describes an essay as:
> ...a relatively short piece of writing on a particular topic.  However, the word essay also means 'attempt' or 'try'. An essay is, therefore, a short piece written by someone attempting to explore a topic or answer a question.

## Why write
Why write an essay? To clearly formulate a set of ideas.
## Resolution
The components of the essay have levels of granularity.
Words > Sentences > Paragraphs > Structure > Essay
>I recommend you take care of the minutes and the hours will take care of themselves.
--<cite>Earl of Chesterfield</cite>

This quote may not be of paramount importance, but the idea is focus. Make the smallest units (words) high quality, and the overall essay will benefit.
## Topic
Choose a topic. This is required to formulate your topic sentence. If you don't have a topic, read or explore until you find one that interests you.
## Reading List
Construct a reading list to build your research. Choose 5-10 books per 1000 essay words you want to write (at ~250 words per page). Have a discourse with your chosen authors. Try to understand what they're really saying. Ideally their books will be as well written as your future essay.
## Outline
Write one sentence per paragraph. Overwrite by 25% so you can cut it down later, leaving the best words, sentences, and ideas.
## Paragraphs
Write an outline will each sub-topic sentence. Then write out all the paragraphs.
## Edit
Align your sentences vertically on the page, with a space underneath each one. Revise each sentence, putting the better one below the original. This is how you can evolve each sentence to better convey your points. Repeat for each sentence in the essay.
## Re-order
After doing this you may find the essay has to be re-worked to better orgranize these ideas. Do so.
## Re-outline
Reconstruct your outline to reflect these changes. Does the overall structure still support your original reason for writing the essay? Do you need additional topic sentences or paragraphs? Is there anything that is no longer necessary? Read it through. Try to rewrite your own outline from memory. If you clearly remember the main points of each paragraph, you are close to being done. If not, repeat the previous steps.
