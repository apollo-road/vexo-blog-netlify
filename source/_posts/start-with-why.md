***

## Selected Notes:
- Manipulate or inspire. The choice is yours. (17)
- Manipulations lead to transactions, not loyalty (30)
- What > How > Why (37)
- a company is a culture (90)
  - hire people who believe what you believe

To illustrate this, read this marvelous quote from page 92:
>Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.
>
-- <cite>Ernest Shackleton</cite>

- innovation happens at the edges (99)
- logo < symbol (162)
  - (think batman, a symbol of hope, versus a bat logo)
- what gets measured gets done (189)
- finding why is a process of discovery, not invention (214)
- arrows are pulled back 180° before fired (214)
- 50% of all marketing works (218)
  - (which 50%??)

One of Sinek's best points:
> When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. When you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.
